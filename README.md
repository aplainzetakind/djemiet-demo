# cemiyet #
_A tool for communities_

### Getting set-up ###

* Obtain Python 3.8.x
* Run `$ pip3.8 install --user pipenv`. This will install `pipenv` in
  `~/.local/bin`. Make sure it's in your `$PATH`.
* Clone the repo
* Go to the project root. Run `pipenv install`. This should install the
  dependencies (`django` and `psycopg2`) in a virtual environment. You will
  likely be missing some build dependencies for `psycopg`. Read here to install
  them on your system (scroll down to Build prequisites):
  https://www.psycopg.org/docs/install.html
* Install postgresql and postgresl-client if you're running a Debian-based linux
  distro. Otherwise, figure out the corresponding package names on your system.
* Running `# su - postgres` will switch you to the user `postgres` (a privileged
  user with access to all postgresql databases). As `postgres`, run `psql`. This
  will drop you into the postgressql shell.
* Follow the instructions under the heading _Create A PostgreSQL User and
  Database_ here: https://djangocentral.com/using-postgresql-with-django/ for
  the username `cemiyet`, databasename `cemiyetdb` and password `sibercan`
  (these values can be found in `cemiyet/cemiyet/settings.py` in the value of
  the constant `DATABASES`). If you want to use your own values, look into the
  usage of the `local_settings.py` file (it will be `.gitignore`d), for instance
  here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4909958/django-local-settings .
* If everything went well, the django app should be able to talk to the
  database. Go to the project root and issue `$ pipenv shell`. This will drop
  you into a virtual environment shell. Chenge to the directory `cemiyet`, where
  `manage.py` lives. Run `$ python manage.py migrate`. This should do some
  stuff, which, if completed without errors, should mean that django can talk to
  your database. To verify this, swith to the `postgres` user as you did before
  on another terminal, __not from the virtual environment__, and drop to the
  postgresql shell as you did before. There, the command `\c cemiyetdb` followed
  by `\d` should show you some django-related stuff. This means all is good.
* Run (from the python virtual environment) `$ python manage.py runserver`. This
  should serve the site, which you should be able to access from your browser at
  `127.0.0.1:8000`. This local site should be enough for development.
* Make yourself a branch and think of something to do. Push to your branch when
  you complete something.

### Convenience ###
* Add the line `213.164.205.34  cemiyet.vps` to `/etc/hosts`. This will allow
  you to use `http://cemiyet.vps` in the browser to access the live site or to
  `$ ssh <username>@cemiyet.vps`. If you use any other name than `cemiyet.vps`,
  the site won't respond, because the name is in the configuration of the
  server.

### TODO ###
* When not logged in, `/` redirects to `/accounts/login`. After that, if the
  user logs in at another tab, then refreshes the current page, he still sees
  the login screen. Reorganize redirects so that the login screen also redirects
  back to `/` when refreshed.

### Feature history ###
- Out of the box Django installation with database setting changes.
- Login wall.

### Docker ###
Postgres :
- Create dir for persistence data (e.g. `$HOME/django/postgres/data`)
- Run command :
```
$ docker run --rm  --name pg -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=XXX -e POSTGRES_USER=XXX -e POSTGRES_DB=XXX -v $HOME/django/postgres/data:/var/lib/postgresql/data postgres
```
# Sample local_settings.py (located at the level of manage.py) #
```
DEBUG = True
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['localhost','0.0.0.0','127.0.0.1']
SECRET_KEY = <Something you generate locally>
```
